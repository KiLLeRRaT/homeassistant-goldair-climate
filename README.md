Home Assistant Goldair WiFi Climate component
=============================================

The `goldair_climate` component integrates 
[Goldair WiFi-enabled heaters](http://www.goldair.co.nz/product-catalogue/heating/wifi-heaters), WiFi-enabled [dehumidifiers](http://www.goldair.co.nz/product-catalogue/heating/dehumidifiers), and WiFi-enabled fans](http://www.goldair.co.nz/product-catalogue/cooling/pedestal-fans/40cm-dc-quiet-fan-with-wifi-and-remote-gcpf315) into Home Assistant, enabling control of setting the following parameters via the UI and the following services:

**Heaters**

**Recently added support for Goldair GECO270 WiFi controlled panel heaters**

* **power** (on/off)
* **mode** (Comfort, Eco, Anti-freeze)
* **target temperature** (`5`-`35` in Comfort mode, `5`-`21` in Eco mode, in Â°C)
* **power level** (via the swing mode setting because no appropriate HA option exists: `Auto`, `1`-`5`, `Stop`)

Current temperature is also displayed.

**Demudifiers**
* **power** (on/off)
* **mode** (Normal, Low, High, Dry clothes, Air clean)
* **target humidity** (`30`-`80`%)

Current temperature is displayed, and current humidity is available as a property.

**Fans**
* **power** (on/off)
* **mode** (Normal, Eco, Sleep)
* **fan mode** (`1`-`12`)
* **swing** (on/off)

**Light**
* **LED display** (on/off)

**Lock** (heaters and dehumidifiers)
* **Child lock** (on/off)

There was previously a sensor option, however this is easily achieved using a [template sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/) and therefore is no longer supported.

### Warning
Please note, this component has currently only been tested with the Goldair GPPH (inverter), GPDH420 (dehumidifier), and GCPF315 fan, however theoretically it should also work with GEPH and GPCV heater devices, may work with the GPDH440 dehumidifier and any other Goldair heaters, dehumidifiers or fans based on the Tuya platform.

Installation
------------
The preferred installation method is via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). Once you have HACS set up, simply follow the [instructions for adding a custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/navigation/settings#custom-repositories) and then the integration will be available to install like any other.

You can also use [Custom Updater](https://github.com/custom-components/custom_updater). Once Custom Updater is  set up, go to the Developer Tools > Service page and call the `custom_updater.install` service with this service data:

```json
{ "element": "goldair_climate" }
```

Alternatively you can copy the contents of this repository's `custom_components` directory to your `<config>/custom_components` directory, however you will not get automatic updates this way.

Configuration
-------------
Add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
goldair_climate:
  - name: My heater
    host: 1.2.3.4
    device_id: <your device id>
    local_key: <your local key>
    type: heater
```

### Configuration variables

#### name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(string) (Required)* Any unique for the device; required because the Tuya API doesn't provide
                                              the one you set in the app.

#### host
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(string) (Required)* IP or hostname of the device.

#### device_id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(string) (Required)* Device ID retrieved 
                                              [as per the instructions below](#finding-your-device-id-and-local-key).

#### local_key
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(string) (Required)* Local key retrieved 
                                              [as per the instructions below](#finding-your-device-id-and-local-key).

#### type
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(string) (Required)* The type of Goldair device: currently `heater`, `dehumidifier` or `fan`.

#### climate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(boolean) (Optional)* Whether to surface this appliance as a climate device.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Default value: true* 

#### display_light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(boolean) (Optional)* Whether to surface this appliance's LED display control as a light.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Default value: false* 

#### child_lock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(boolean) (Optional)* Whether to surface this appliances's child lock as a lock device (not supported for fans).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Default value: false* 

Heater gotchas
--------------
Goldair heaters have individual target temperatures for their Comfort and Eco modes, whereas Home Assistant only supports
a single target temperature. Therefore, when you're in Comfort mode you will set the Comfort temperature (`5`-`35`), and
when you're in Eco mode you will set the Eco temperature (`5`-`21`), just like you were using the heater's own control 
panel. Bear this in mind when writing automations that change the operation mode and set a temperature at the same time: 
you must change the operation mode *before* setting the new target temperature, otherwise you will set the current 
thermostat rather than the new one. 

When switching to Anti-freeze mode, the heater will set the current power level to `1` as if you had manually chosen it.
When you switch back to other modes, you will no longer be in `Auto` and will have to set it again if this is what you
wanted. This could be worked around in code however it would require storing state that may be cleared if HA is
restarted and due to this unreliability it's probably best that you just factor it into your automations.

When child lock is enabled, the heater's display will flash with the child lock symbol (`[]`) whenever you change
something in HA. This can be confusing because it's the same behaviour as when you try to change something via the
heater's own control panel and the change is rejected due to being locked, however rest assured that the changes *are* 
taking effect.

Fan gotchas
-----------
In my experience, fans don't like to receive a lot of commands in a short period of time. They will emit two fast beeps when accepting a command, and two slow beeps when rejecting one. If you are writing automations for your fan and need to set multiple properties, you may need to put a delay of around 5 seconds or more between each.

Finding your device ID and local key 
------------------------------------
You can find these keys the same way as you would for any Tuya local integration. You'll need the Tuya Smart app rather
than the Goldair app (the Goldair app is just a re-branded clone of Tuya Smart).

* [Instructions for iOS](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md)
* [Instructions for Android](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/blob/cdb4289/docs/SETUP_DEPRECATED.md#capture-https-traffic)

You're looking for `uuid` (this is the device ID) and the `localKey` values.

Next steps
----------
This component needs specs! Once they're written I'm considering submitting it to the HA team for inclusion in standard 
installations. Please report any issues and feel free to raise pull requests.
